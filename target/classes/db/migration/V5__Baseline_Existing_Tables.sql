-- This migration file is used to baseline the existing tables
-- that were manually created in the database
-- Flyway will mark this as completed without making any changes

-- The following tables already exist and are baselined:
-- vfd_transactions
-- vfd_customer_profiles  
-- vfd_instruments
-- vfd_holdings
-- vfd_api_logs
-- vfd_notifications
-- vfd_settlements
-- vfd_reconciliations

-- This is a no-op migration to satisfy Flyway's versioning requirements
